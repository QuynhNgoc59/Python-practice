TYPE: Easy 

==> My approach:
# import pandas as pd

def queries_stats(queries: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    # Calculate quality per query 
    queries['quality'] = queries['rating'] / queries['position'] + 1e-10

    # Calculate the the poor queries %
    queries['poor_query_percentage'] = np.where(queries['rating'] < 3, 100, 0)
    
    # Calculate the avg % of quality & poor queries
    final_calculation = (
        queries.groupby(by=('query_name'))[['quality', 'poor_query_percentage']]
               .mean()
               .round(2)
               .reset_index()
    )
    return final_calculation
